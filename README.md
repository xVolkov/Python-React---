The Task Manager is a web app for efficient task management, featuring user authentication, task persistence, and user-specific task management. It ensures data privacy, allowing only users to access their tasks. Users can create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks, all supported by a Python Flask backend with RESTful APIs.
